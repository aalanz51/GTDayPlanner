GT Bootcamp Day Planner Homework

This week's challenge was to build a day planner to help organize yourself.

In this activity we utilize our newly acquired skills such as columns/ rows grid making, time placement, and pulling from web API resources like jQuery, bootstrap, etc. The design is fairly straight forward and minimal with a bit of whimsy in the coloring to keep a professional yet fun aesthetic.

The mock up for how the link should load is as follows:
